<b><h3>Greetings from the NIE IEEE Student Branch!

The internet isn't just a happy sunlit chorus of birds but also a terrifying dark center of negativity. Treading steps into these dark corners can leave one scarred and traumatized, however, darkness can be vanquished, one just needs to bring in the light. An empty site could be enough for the devil to code and host, a ray of positivity can bring it down! What evilness does come your way? 

Yes, NISB whips up, on the occasion of the All Saint's Day or Halloween, "Website Design Competition"! With the theme of Halloween, we dare you to scare us or wow us with your content on a single-page website. Evaluation based on UI and design layout, upload your content on Github, and submit the repository URL in the link below! You are allowed to use only HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript  (no frameworks allowed) and you aren't required to host your website! </h3></b><br><br><hr>
